Introduction
============

This is an internal workshop I delivered as an introduction to D3.js

Getting started
===============

The workshop consists of a walkthrough in presentation format, and
some templates in which to build your code.

The finished product is included in the `Examples/` folder.

Opening the presentation
------------------------

The presentation can be found at `Presentation/index.html`, just open
it in your web browser

Working through the walkthrough
--------------------------------

Your browser may not allow access to the local dataset file if opened
directly, so you will need to run a local webserver.

    # Using the http-server npm
    $ npm install -g http-server
    $ http-server Templates -p 3000

You should then be able to view the tutorial files in your web-browser
at:

    http://localhost:3000/
